# EduAssist

## Introduction

This Flutter application is designed to assist educators with two key tasks: creating lesson plans and providing automated feedback on student essays. Leveraging the power of Google Cloud Platform and cutting-edge AI, this app aims to streamline teaching workflows and enhance student learning. The frontend is built using Flutter and developed with the help of Google's Project IDX platform, ensuring a modern and efficient development experience. The backend utilizes Google Cloud Functions and the Google Gemini API to provide intelligent lesson plan generation and essay analysis.

2.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL
    cd myapp
    ```
    *(Replace `YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL` with the actual URL of your project's Git repository.)*

3.  **Get Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```
    This command downloads all the necessary Flutter packages and dependencies for the project.

4.  **Running the App:**
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```
    This command builds and runs the Flutter application on your connected device or emulator.

**Note:** The automated features of this application rely on Google Cloud Functions and the Google Gemini API. To fully utilize these features in a deployed environment, you will need to:

* Set up a Google Cloud Project.
* Enable the Cloud Functions and Generative AI services.
* Deploy the backend Cloud Functions (code for which would be provided separately).
* Obtain a Gemini API key and configure it as an environment variable for your Cloud Function.
* Update the frontend code with the correct URL for your deployed Cloud Function.

This README provides a basic overview for running the Flutter frontend locally. Deployment of the backend and full integration with cloud services requires additional configuration on Google Cloud Platform.
